#Lab 8 - MBTA part 1

The implementation of this project correctly implements the main features laid out in the specs. The map takes up the entire page, it is centered on south station, each station has a marker with an icon that is not the standard marker, a red polyline connects each station appropriately (and takes into account the line split at JFK/UMass), and the project contains separate css and javascript files. The only sort of downfall was that I resized the icon image externally rather than using javascript (I could not figure out how to do so in javascript so I edited the actual file to change the image dimensions). 

I did not collaborate with anyone on this assignment, but I referenced the following google tutorials:
https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/adding-a-google-map
https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/polyline-simple
https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial
https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/custom-markers
and the gmap_api_example.html.

I spent approximately 5-6 hours on this assignment.

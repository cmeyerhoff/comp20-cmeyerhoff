#Lab 13

This project successfully achieves the desired objectives as laid out in the assignment prompt. All parts of the assignment are present - my project contains an Introduction, Methodology, Abstract of findings, an in depth look at the issues, a conclusion, and is in html format with thoughtful layout. 

I spent approximately 16 hours on this assignment (got bogged down in trying too many XSS attacks I think!)

I did not collaborate with anyone on this assignment, but I referenced piazza as well as the following:

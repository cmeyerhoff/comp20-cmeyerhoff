	<h1>Assignment 4: Security and Privacy Assessment of a Web Application</h1>
	<h2> Introduction </h2>
		<p>The product that is being tested here is "Not Foursquare." It is basically a tool where users can check in and log their coordinates, and accessing the main page yields all of the people who have checked in and their coordinates. The users login name and coordinates are stored in a connected database.</p>
		<p>It is my duty to examine the security of this web service. It is unclear whether the site was intended to allow only certain users to log their coordinates or to allow everyone to log their coordinates, but the security analysis will examine both use cases.</p>
	<h2> Methodology </h2>
		<p>The methodology used was primarily "white box" testing, where the source code was examined for vulnerabilities before attempting to test them on the actual service. This was done because when starting I did not know where to start or how to go about "black box" testing. The tools eventually used to test the security of the web application were curl, Postman, Google Chrome, and a bash shell script. </p>
	<h2>Abstract of Findings </h2>
	 	<p>The web application has numerous security issues that could affect stability of the service, user experience, user's browser security, and potentially data security. The main offenders are as follows:</p>
	 	<ol>
	 		<li>Malicious user input is allowed and is sent back to every clients browser upon a refresh, which can lead to:
	 			<ul>
	 				<li>Altering the content of the webpage</li>
	 				<li>Phishing attempts with phony forms</li>
	 				<li>Redirecting the user to another website</li>
	 				<li>Making the website inaccessible or unusable</li>
	 				<li>Crashing the user's browser</li>
	 				<li>Accessing cookies containing personal data if they are ever implemented</li>
	 			</ul>
 			</li> 
	 		<li>All of the data in the databse collection is accessable in an easily usable form via an injection attack at one of the separate </li>
	 		<li>The database can be flooded and potentially have its resources consumed by repeated logging</li>
	 	</ol>
	<h2>Issues Found </h2>

		For each issue that you find, document:
		Issue (e.g., database injection, really bad programming practice)
		Location / page where issue was found
		Severity of issue (e.g., low, medium , or high). Justify your answer.
		Description of issue. How did you find it? A screenshot of problem is excellent.
		Proof of vulnerability. Screenshots are important.
		Resolution. Make recommendation(s) on how issue can be resolved. Show code if possible.
	<h2>Conclusion </h2>
		You can also list future considerations and recommendations with costs.

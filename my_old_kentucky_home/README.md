#Lab 6 - My Old Kentucky Home

Using the given html file, I added Javascript such that the lyrics to the song "My Old Kentucky Home" are displayed under the video as it plays. This functions as described by the spec. It annotates lyrics in forward direction, but will not work in reverse. It could be modified to do so by making the times to display lyrics ranges (ie 6 seconds to 11 seconds) instead of just a single time that serves as a point to switch lyrics. I determined this did what the assignment asked, and eschwed need for writing out many if statements that could be needed in alternate methods. Working on changing this.
